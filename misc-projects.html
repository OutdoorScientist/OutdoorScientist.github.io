						I built an ergonomic mouse using a Raspberry Pi Zero W to translate Xbox controller inputs into
						binary mouse and keyboard commands, creating a universal HID device. This project taught me HID
						communication, Python scripting, and automating tasks on boot.
					</p>
					<p>
						I also developed Python scripts to scrape and consolidate website content, improving my skills
						with BeautifulSoup, regular expressions, and task automation.
					</p>
					<p>
						Additionally, I automated a medical receipt organizer using a Raspberry Pi 3B to scan and store
						receipts with a single button press, deepening my knowledge of Raspberry Pi, terminal commands,
						and printer integration on Linux.

						<h2>Custom Computer Mouse</h2>
						<p>
							My wrist was hurting so I decided to build a personal, ergonomic computer mouse. I
							successfully achieved by programming a raspberry pi zero W to be register as a human
							interactive device (HID) when plugged into a computer. I was then able to connect an xbox
							controller to the raspberry pi zero through bluetooth. Then I was able to capture the
							inputs from the xbox controller and convert them into binary mouse and keyboard inputs. The
							xbox mouse outputs were translated into mouse and keyboard computer inputs by the raspberry
							pi. No additional software was needed on the host computer making it a universal device.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Learned how human interactive devices communicate with a computer.</li>
							<li>Learned the binary inputs for a keyboard and mouse.</li>
							<li>Learned how to setup a raspberry pi to execute scripts on boot.</li>
							<li>Learned how to setup a custom python library for shared functions.</li>
							<li>Learned the difference between power cables and data cables.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Web Scrappers</h2>
						<p>
							I have come across a number of situations in which information is spread across multiple
							websites that I determined would be better if it were all accumulated. Therefore, I built
							python scripts that would load the website, extract the desired content, save the content to
							a text file, and modify that document to highlight important information.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Learned how to use BeautifulSoup, set python scripts to execute at particular times,
								execute python scripts for certain durations, and handle exceptions.
							</li>
							<li>Improved my Regular Expression use.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<div class="timeline-content">
						<h2>Medical Receipt Manager</h2>
						<p>
							I recently opened a Health Savings Account (HSA) which requires me to keep track of my
							health related purchases in order to be reimbursed at a later date. I decided to
							investigate ways I could automate the tracking of these receipts in order to better manage
							everything. I ended up connecting a printer/scanner to a Raspberry Pi 3B in which I could
							control the printer through terminal commands. Upon boot of the PI a python script is
							executed that monitors a button input. With the push of this button, the scanner is
							triggered, and the resultant scan is saved with an ascending filename to a hard drive.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Learned more about the Raspbian OS, creating directories through terminal commands,
								verifying directories exists, and accessing external storage from the terminal.
							</li>
							<li>
								Learned about the drivers of printers and the open source software to connect through
								them on Linux.
							</li>
