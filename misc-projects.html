						One of my passions outside of work is inventing and building things that combine various skills.
						I have experience in woodworking, welding, electrical, and mechanical work, along with
						experience in embedded systems, microprocessors, and programming.
					</p>
					<p>
						These hobbies reflect my professional approach as a software developer. They demonstrate my
						ability to break down complex problems, learn new technologies quickly, and apply that knowledge
						creatively to build solutions. I enjoy working across disciplines, which mirrors my ability to
						contribute to multiple aspects of software development, from front-end work to technical
						problem-solving and hardware integration.

						<h2>Custom Human Interactive Device (HID) Embedded System</h2>
						<p>I created a custom ergonomic computer mouse to alleviate wrist pain.</p>
						<p>
							I programmed a Raspberry Pi Zero W to function as a human interface device (HID) when
							connected to a computer. By pairing an Xbox controller with the Raspberry Pi via Bluetooth,
							I captured its inputs and converted them into binary signals for mouse and keyboard actions.
							This allowed the Xbox controller to operate as both a mouse and keyboard, with the Raspberry
							Pi managing the conversionâ€”no additional software required on the host computer. I mapped
							the controller buttons to keyboard shortcuts and the joysticks to mouse movements.
						</p>
						<p>
							This unique setup, with button-to-shortcut mapping and the lack of software dependency on
							the host computer, distinguishes my project from other similar devices. The entire project
							was developed using Python and shell scripts.
						</p>
						<p>During this project, I accomplished the following:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Developed a unique ergonomic mouse and keyboard system that functions universally
								without requiring additional software on the host computer, utilizing Python, shell
								scripting, binary Bluetooth descriptors, a Raspberry Pi Zero W, and an Xbox controller.
							</li>
							<li>
								Gained an understanding of how human interface devices (HIDs) communicate with
								computers.
							</li>
							<li>Learned how to interpret and use binary inputs for both keyboards and mice.</li>
							<li>
								Set up a Raspberry Pi to register as a HID on power up through automatic execution of
								scripts.
							</li>
							<li>
								Developed a custom Python library to remap all the outputs of an xbox controller into
								mouse movements and keyboard inputs
							</li>
							<li>
								Learned the distinction between power cables and data cables and their appropriate
								applications.
							</li>

						<h2>Web Scrappers</h2>
						<p>
							I have come across a number of situations in which information is spread across multiple
							websites that I determined would be better if it were all accumulated. Therefore, I built
							python scripts that would load the website, extract the desired content, save the content to
							a text file, and modify that document to highlight important information.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Learned how to use BeautifulSoup, set python scripts to execute at particular times,
								execute python scripts for certain durations, and handle exceptions.
							</li>
							<li>Improved my Regular Expression use.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Medical Receipt Manager Embedded System</h2>
						<p>
							Automated the scanning and tracking of health-related receipts for efficient management and
							future integration with a machine learning model.
						</p>
						<p>
							I recently opened a Health Savings Account (HSA), which requires me to track my
							health-related purchases for future reimbursement. To simplify this process, I decided to
							automate the tracking of my receipts. I connected a printer/scanner to a Raspberry Pi 3B,
							allowing me to control the device using terminal commands. Now, when the Raspberry Pi boots
							up, a Bash script monitors the GPIO pins, and pressing an external button triggers the
							scanner. The scanned file is automatically saved to a hard drive with a unique, ascending
							filename. This setup makes it easy to store, manage, and track receipts for medical
							purchases. Additionally, I plan to incorporate a machine learning model for image-to-text
							extraction, which will populate a CSV file with relevant receipt data, further streamlining
							the tracking process.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Gained a deeper understanding of Linux operating systems and how to monitor GPIO pins.
							</li>
							<li>
								Successfully created dynamically named and organized directories on external storage
								devices through Bash scripts triggered on external physical button presses.
							</li>
							<li>
								Gained knowledge on various printer drivers and open-source software to enable their
								seamless integration with Linux operating systems.
							</li>
						</ul>
