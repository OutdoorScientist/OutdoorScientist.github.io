						</div>

						<div id="point-1"><h2>1. Work Ethic and Attitude</h2></div>
						<h3 class="list-padding">Motivation:</h3>
						<p class="list-padding-2">
							I’m driven by the opportunity to take on challenging yet meaningful work, especially when it
							allows room for creativity and problem-solving. I find fulfillment in roles that push me to
							grow, make an impact, and think outside the box. When I’m in a position that combines these
							elements, I feel fortunate and deeply motivated to contribute my best.
						</p>
						<h3 class="list-padding">Work style:</h3>
						<p class="list-padding-2">
							I am highly capable of working independently and taking ownership of my tasks, which allows
							me to stay focused and deliver results efficiently. However, I also thrive in a team
							environment, as I enjoy collaborating, exchanging ideas, and contributing to shared goals. I
							find that balancing independence with teamwork helps me perform at my best and adapt to
							different situations.
						</p>
						<h3 class="list-padding">Resilience:</h3>
						<p class="list-padding-2">
							At AVEVA, I worked on a three-month project that, despite being completed and merged into
							the main branch, was reverted shortly after because the stakeholders were dissatisfied with
							the workflow—ironically, the one they had requested. This experience taught me the
							importance of maintaining clear communication and setting expectations with stakeholders
							throughout a project. While the outcome was disappointing, I used it as an opportunity to
							reflect, remain composed, and adapt my approach. It strengthened my ability to handle
							setbacks with professionalism and focus on learning and improving for future projects.
						</p>

						<div id="point-2"><h2>2. Cultural Fit</h2></div>
						<h3 class="list-padding">Values alignment:</h3>
						<p class="list-padding-2">
							I place a high value on delivering quality, ethical, and meaningful work. Integrity and
							purpose are central to my approach, and I strive to make a positive impact through my
							contributions. My mission is to work with companies that have a clear sense of purpose and
							align with my commitment to ethical practices and delivering lasting value.
						</p>
						<h3 class="list-padding">Interpersonal skills:</h3>
						<p class="list-padding-2">
							I collaborate effectively with a diverse range of individuals and teams. At AVEVA, I worked
							with colleagues across the United States and internationally, navigating time zones and
							cultural differences to achieve shared goals. At Terracon, I coordinated closely with
							drillers and clients in the field, while also keeping project managers across the country
							informed to ensure smooth project execution. My experience has taught me to adapt my
							communication style, listen actively, and build strong working relationships, no matter the
							team or setting.
						</p>
						<h3 class="list-padding">Adaptability:</h3>
						<p class="list-padding-2">
							During my time at Terracon as a field geologist, I honed my ability to thrive in loud,
							fast-paced, and dynamically changing environments and contracted drilling teams. This
							experience taught me how to quickly adapt to new workflows, personalities, and challenges.
							As a result, I’ve become highly adaptable and find it natural to adjust to varying company
							cultures and dynamics while maintaining productivity and building strong working
							relationships.
						</p>

						<div id="point-3"><h2>3. Interests and Hobbies</h2></div>
						<h3 class="list-padding">Creativity:</h3>
						<p class="list-padding-2">
							I have a variety of completed and ongoing programming projects that demonstrate my
							creativity and problem-solving abilities, each incorporating different technologies, skill
							sets, and knowledge areas. For example, my heavy-duty robotic arm project combines object
							detection, Python programming, and computer interfacing with an understanding of physics,
							design principles, and engineering. This project reflects my ability to integrate diverse
							disciplines to solve complex challenges while showcasing both technical expertise and
							creative thinking.
						</p>
						<h3 class="list-padding">Team activities:</h3>
						<p class="list-padding-2">
							I am an avid rock climber, particularly in sport climbing, which requires a high degree of
							trust, communication, and teamwork to ensure safety and success. Beyond climbing, I’ve also
							demonstrated teamwork and leadership in professional settings. For instance, during my
							internship, I took on the role of scrum master, effectively coordinating the team to
							complete the project on time. Additionally, I led drilling teams on-site at Terracon,
							overseeing over 75 fault-free drilling operations. These experiences reflect my ability to
							lead, collaborate, and achieve goals in both recreational and professional environments.
						</p>
						<h3 class="list-padding">Well-roundedness:</h3>
						<p class="list-padding-2">
							I’m passionate about my programming projects, but I also enjoy a variety of hands-on and
							creative activities outside of work. I work on vehicles, which sharpens my problem-solving
							and technical skills. I play music, which allows me to be creative through improvisation. I
							paint, which helps me relax and think visually. Additionally, I enjoy training my dogs,
							which has taught me patience and the value of consistent effort. These hobbies provide a
							well-rounded balance to my life and reflect my diverse interests and skills.
						</p>

						<div id="point-4"><h2>4. Communication Style</h2></div>
						<h3 class="list-padding">How I express myself in professional and casual settings:</h3>

							stages of a project. In casual settings, I maintain a friendly, approachable demeanor,
							building rapport while being respectful and mindful of others.
						</p>
						<h3 class="list-padding">My listening and conversational skills:</h3>
						<p class="list-padding-2">
							I have strong listening and conversational skills. While working at AVEVA, I learned that
							clarifying stakeholder requests during initial meetings could save hours of work and prevent
							miscommunication down the line. By actively listening, thinking through the implementation
							in real time, and asking insightful questions upfront, I was able to anticipate potential
							challenges and address them early.
						</p>

						<div id="point-5"><h2>5. Goals and Aspirations</h2></div>

						<p class="list-padding-2">
							In the short term, my primary goal is to improve my coding skills to write cleaner, more
							efficient code at a faster pace. This will allow me to take on larger, more complex
							projects. Additionally, I aim to deepen my understanding of the entire software development
							life cycle so I can contribute more meaningfully at every stage of the process.
