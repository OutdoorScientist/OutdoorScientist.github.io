						<h2>Heavy Duty Robotic Arm Vision</h2>
						<p>
							I researched, designed, and started construction of a heavy duty robotic arm that loads my
							dishwasher with dirty dishes pulled from the sink. I was able to achieve this through the
							combination of a custom object identification machine learning model and stereo imaging for
							depth data.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Captured, organized, and annotated hundreds of images of dirty dishes in order to train
								a machine learning object identification model
							</li>
							<li>
								Figured out a way to use the previous models to annotate the images in which I could
								review them in order to speed up data generation and accuracy.
							</li>
							<li>
								Learned how to train models off of already trained models in order to enable a single
								machine learning model to identify multiple items.
							</li>
							<li>
								Went through a series of revisions as I discovered limitations and model needs in order
								to achieve the defined objective. For example, I discovered the need to identify the
								sink and counter due to the need for environment awareness for the robotic arm.
							</li>
							<li>
								Successfully trained and validated an 89% accurate model that could identify the
								counter, sink, mugs, cups, bowls, silverware, and plates of varying sizes and colors.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>ELRC's Machine Learning SaaS</h2>
						<p>
							My role was to enable Texas school leaders to gauge their school's STAAR performance through
							the use of a novel machine learning model, with over 90% accuracy, in order to optimize
							their school's test preparation.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Successfully deployed a SaaS with an integrated ML model to AWS.</li>
							<li>
								Learned to clarify with clients how to organize student training data in order to
								accelerate model training.
							</li>
							<li>Implemented SciKit-Learn machine learning model with margin of error.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<br />
					<div class="timeline-content">
						<h2>Webcam Assistance</h2>
						<p>
							I created an accessible Webcam Adjustment Site that helps those with visual impairments
							(i.e. astigmatism, blind, etc..) setup their webcams by themselves.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Implemented robust logic to make accessible recommendations based on confirmed webcam
								input, room lighting, the webcam's vertical and horizontal tilt, and the centering of
								the feed on the main person.
							</li>
							<li>
								These recommendations are derived using a facial recognition model, image-based python
								libraries, and intermediate math.
							</li>
